                Our clients come from many different industry sectors and many through referral.
                We think this is testimony to the quality of our solutions and the importance we
                place on creating a rewarding working relationship with them.</p>
            <p>
                But you don't have to take our word for it, read what some of our clients have to
                say about us below in testimonials.</p>
                  
                <h3 style="color:#145b86;"> SJE Carpentry &amp; Joinery</h3>
                <p> A specialist supply and fit joinery subcontractor, with a turnover of £5.5 million.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify"> &quot;Simplicity has given our business a complete structure and helped us maintain our
                  competitive edge. It’s not just that we can demonstrate we have a complete business
                  process working. I now have tight control over projects, over tendering and pricing
                  and everyone is working much more smoothly as a team.&quot;</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify"> &quot;I now have a business that will do well even in these tough times for the construction
                  industry. I recommend Simplicity wholeheartedly.&quot;</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify"> &quot;A great return on our investment even in the first few months. As a direct result
                  we are staying on tendering lists and winning contracts when larger competitors
                  are struck off.&quot;</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify; font-style: italic;"> Jim Sanders, Joint MD, SJE Carpentry &amp; Joinery </p>
                <p> <a style="color:#145b86; font-weight:bold; font-size:13px;" href="Docs/Simplicity_SJE_Case Study.pdf" target="_blank">Click here</a> for a case study on SJE using
                  Simplicity. </p>
                <h3 style="color:#145b86;"> ESL Landscape Contractors</h3>
                <p> The landscape contractors of choice for major contractors, working on projects such
                  as St Georges Hospital, Combe Haven Leisure Park, and Rose Bruford College.</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify"> &quot;Simplicity has made a huge difference to the way my landscape contracting business
                  works. My sales team now tracks hundreds of sales leads and tenders with ease. What
                  a change from when we used to work from 20 different Excel spreadsheets and had
                  to update each one manually! And because we have all the latest information at our
                  finger tips, our tenders are much easier to prepare and priced competitively.&quot;</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify"> &quot;It doesn’t matter whether our sales team is in the office or on the road – they
                  can get full details of the contact history before they call on a prospective client
                  and easily update our records once the call is complete.&quot;</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify"> &quot;Simplicity has delivered everything we want so far and I strongly suspect it will
                  exceed our expectations as I now have lots of ideas about how to exploit its power
                  throughout our business.&quot;</p>

                <h3 style="color:#145b86;"> J O'Connor </h3>
                <p> The plumbing and maintenance contractor of choice for one of Greater London’s biggest affordable housing suppliers, Paddington Churches Housing Association (PCHA).</p>
                <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify"> &quot;As a supplier, it’s a major priority to get important data back to the client as quickly and easily as possible….Simplicity allows most vital information to be inputted on site so important information is sent back to base about a site visit or a job. It also helps us on the service management aspect of our business. In many ways, we couldn’t do our job without Simplicity. It ensures I can give my clients the level of service they demand, simplifies my administration and logistics, and generally makes us a more productive organisation.&quot;</p>
