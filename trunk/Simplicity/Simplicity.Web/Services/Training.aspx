    Training</h2>
<p>
    Simplicity is so easy to use that you'll be up and running in no time at all.</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, we offer best-in-class on-site training modules for your office and
    field teams. Our team of highly skilled trainers can provide practical lessons on
    how to get the most out of Simplicity.</p>
<h2>
    Support</h2>

    We know that customer service is just as important as the software we're offering,
    which is why we pride ourselves on providing expert support. With no voicemail but
    real people to talk to, our customer service team is highly trained and capable
    of handling the most complex and in-depth issues.</p>
