            Here’s what some of our customers have been saying about us.</p>

            SJE Carpentry & Joinery</h3>
        <p>
            A specialist supply and fit joinery subcontractor, with a turnover of £5.5 million.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify">
            "Simplicity has given our business a complete structure and helped us maintain our
            competitive edge. It’s not just that we can demonstrate we have a complete business
            process working. I now have tight control over projects, over tendering and pricing
            and everyone is working much more smoothly as a team."</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify">
            "I now have a business that will do well even in these tough times for the construction
            industry. I recommend Simplicity wholeheartedly."</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify">
            "A great return on our investment even in the first few months. As a direct result
            we are staying on tendering lists and winning contracts when larger competitors
            are struck off."</p>

            ESL Landscape Contractors</h3>
        <p>
            The landscape contractors of choice for major contractors, working on projects such
            as St Georges Hospital, Combe Haven Leisure Park, and Rose Bruford College.</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify">
            "Simplicity has made a huge difference to the way my landscape contracting business
            works. My sales team now tracks hundreds of sales leads and tenders with ease. What
            a change from when we used to work from 20 different Excel spreadsheets and had
            to update each one manually! And because we have all the latest information at our
            finger tips, our tenders are much easier to prepare and priced competitively."</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify">
            "It doesn’t matter whether our sales team is in the office or on the road – they
            can get full details of the contact history before they call on a prospective client
            and easily update our records once the call is complete."</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify">
            "Simplicity has delivered everything we want so far and I strongly suspect it will
            exceed our expectations as I now have lots of ideas about how to exploit its power
            throughout our business."</p>

        <p>
            The plumbing and maintenance contractor of choice for one of Greater London’s biggest affordable housing suppliers, Paddington Churches Housing Association (PCHA).</p>
        <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px; text-align: justify">
            "As a supplier, it’s a major priority to get important data back to the client as quickly and easily as possible….Simplicity allows most vital information to be inputted on site so important information is sent back to base about a site visit or a job. It also helps us on the service management aspect of our business. In many ways, we couldn’t do our job without Simplicity. It ensures I can give my clients the level of service they demand, simplifies my administration and logistics, and generally makes us a more productive organisation."</p>
