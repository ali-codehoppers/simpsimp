    The resource managment suite is more than just a diary. All entries within it can
    be linked to other departments to ensure more efficent business performance.</p>
<p>
    For example, site managers can use it to log staff time on timesheets which are
    then automatically co-orinated by payroll. For seamless business the resources management
    tool is a must.</p>
<p>
    Also, unlike less sophisticated software with this software incorporates a postcode
    checker so you can track staff and assets. This function then allows you to view
    your data by postcode or region, as well as day, week, month, resource, job</p>
